 <h2>Character</h2>

Beagles are full of energy and are perfect for people who spend time actively. Beagle which is unable to discharge energy, will destroy furniture or dig the garden out of boredom.
Beagles tolerate loneliness very badly, and, left alone for hours, can howl, destroy objects or deliberately treat your couch as a bathroom. 
</p>
