<h2> Neonatal stage - 0 to 12 days </h2>

	<p>At birth, the puppy is blind and deaf, so it initially explores the world through his other senses. 
	A puppy at this age is completely dependent on its mother. Following her heat, it goes to the food source. 
	During the first days after birth, puppies should not be separated from their mother even for a moment. It is best not to touch them and not try to pick them up, so as not to disturb the mother. 
	</p>
	<h2>Transitional stage - from 13th to 20th day </h2>

	<p>Puppies are livelier and begin to play with each other. At this age they learn the so-called bite inhibition - how hard they can bite without causing pain. 
	If they don\'t acquire this skill, it will be virtually impossible to catch up in later life. 
	Contact with people is also important at this stage. At the end of the third week, the dogs begin to eat from the bowl and walk on all fours instead of crawling. 
	At the beginning of the transition period, puppies open their eyes and at the end they begin to hear. 
	</p>
	<h2>Socialization stage - from 4th to 12th week </h2>
	<figure>

</figure>
	<p>This is a very important stage in a dog\'s life and we should take advantage of it. 
	The puppy makes social contacts, learns the rules of the herd. 
	Between 8 and 11 weeks of age, the puppy begins to feel fear, so it\'s important not to put him under a lot of stress during this period. 
	Anything a puppy sees during socialization will later be a normal part of the world for him. 
	So let\'s get the dog familiar with the elements that it will often deal with later, e.g. if you want to travel with the dog by bus, it is worth going for a short ride, or at least taking the dog to the bus stop. 
	The big problem is that most puppies are in quarantine after vaccinations during socialization stage. 
	There are two options: go with your puppy to places that are not frequented by other dogs so that it does not get infected, or carry your puppy in the so-called socialization bag. 
	The risk of a puppy getting infected is fairly small, and it is more important that the dog is properly socialized and does not become wild. 
	</p>
	<h2>Youth stage - from 3rd to about 6th month </h2>
	<figure>

  <figcaption style="text-align:center">Bianka at the age of 4 months.</figcaption>
</figure>
	<p>During this period, differences in development depending on the breed begin to become apparent - in general, large breed dogs mature a little more slowly than smaller dogs. 
	It is then a period of re-socialization, we should still introduce the puppy to new stimuli. 
	Young dogs are becoming more and more independent, they do not return to their owners as willingly as they used to. 
	At the end of this period, males start looking for a future mate and females have their first heat. 
	</p>
	<h2>Maturation stage - from 6th to about 14th month </h2>
	<figure>

  <figcaption style="text-align:center">Young Beagle.</figcaption>
</figure>
	<p>This is a period of rebellion that some dogs go through more stormily, others less. There are major hormonal changes in the dog\'s body.
	During this period, strange, unexpected behaviors may occur, e.g. the dog may become afraid of items that have not been a problem for him so far. 
	</p>
	<h2>Adult stage - reached after from 1 to about 4 years </h2>
		<figure>

  <figcaption style="text-align:center">Adult, calmer Beagle.</figcaption>
</figure>
	<p>During this period, dogs have a fully developed psyche and have reached their target size and appearance physically. 
	This is the age when the dog should already know its place in the herd.
	Depending on the breed, the dog becomes more stable and calm at some point during this period (it could be after a year, two, three or more). 
	</p>
	<h2>Senility stage </h2>
	<figure>
  <img src="img/old-dog.jpg" alt="Old dog" style="width:70%;display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
  <figcaption style="text-align:center">Elderly dog.</figcaption>

	<p>We can talk about old age in a dog at various ages, depending on the breed and size. 
	In general, large breed dogs live shorter lives, e.g. Great Danes live only 6-8 years. On average, domestic dogs live to be around 10-13 years. 
	Signs of aging include difficulty with moving, being less active, and deteriorating eyesight and hearing. 
	Often seniors are less likely to establish contacts with other dogs, they may show fear or aggression. 
	During this time, it is important to properly care for the dog, choose its diet accordingly, and if necessary, support the dog\'s body with supplements or medications. 
	Caring for an old dog can cause many worries, but it is worth taking care of our pet\'s health in order to enjoy its company as long as possible.
